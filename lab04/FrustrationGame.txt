Consider "Simple Frustration" game from lecture lect04
where we reviewed how to consider the responsibility of creating
each Spot object
• What was the GRASP pattern/s we used?
• Applying this pattern
• one person determines for (i) Piece and (ii) Die, which object will be
used to create that?
• other person determines for (i) Board and (ii) Player, which object will
be used to create that?
• Take it in turns to explain what you have decided.
• Do you both agree? Is there more than 1 answer? How will you decide which
is the best answer?

All classes for simple "Frustration" game:
Board, Player, Spot, Die, Piece, Spot Factory, Game ?Turn, Round,

i) Piece is created by Player
ii) Die is created by Board/Piece
iii) Board is created by Main/Game
iiii) Player is created by Board/Main(user's input)

Which object do you think has the role
• Of rolling the dice - Player/Turn
• Of moving a pieces - Player/Turn
• Of declaring a winner - Board/Spot
